# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them.
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in
# the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence
# looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
